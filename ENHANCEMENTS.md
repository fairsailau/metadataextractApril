# Enhanced Document Categorization Module

This document provides an overview of the enhancements made to the document categorization module in the Box Metadata Extraction application.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Multi-Factor Confidence Scoring
The enhanced module now calculates confidence scores based on multiple factors:
- AI model's reported confidence
- Response quality (structure and completeness)
- Category specificity
- Reasoning quality
- Document features alignment with category

### 2. Two-Stage Categorization
Documents with low confidence now undergo a second, more detailed analysis with a specialized prompt that:
- Evaluates the document against all possible categories
- Provides scores for each category
- Delivers more detailed reasoning

### 3. Confidence Visualization
The module now provides:
- Color-coded confidence meters (green, yellow, red)
- Detailed breakdown of confidence factors
- Expandable confidence factor explanations

### 4. Confidence Thresholds
Users can now configure:
- Auto-accept threshold for high-confidence results
- Verification threshold for medium-confidence results
- Rejection threshold for low-confidence results

### 5. User Feedback System
The module now includes:
- Category override functionality
- Confidence rating collection
- Feedback-based confidence calibration

### 6. Confidence Validation
Users can now:
- Create validation examples with known categories
- Test categorization against these examples
- View accuracy metrics by confidence level

### 7. Multi-Model Consensus
For critical documents, users can:
- Run categorization with multiple AI models
- Combine results using weighted voting
- Get more robust categorization results

## Implementation Details

### New Dependencies
The enhanced module requires additional dependencies:
- pandas
- altair
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

### New Functions
- `calculate_multi_factor_confidence()`: Computes confidence based on multiple factors
- `display_confidence_visualization()`: Renders visual confidence indicators
- `get_confidence_explanation()`: Provides human-readable confidence explanations
- `configure_confidence_thresholds()`: Manages confidence threshold settings
- `apply_confidence_thresholds()`: Applies thresholds to categorization results
- `collect_user_feedback()`: Gathers user feedback on categorization
- `calibrate_confidence_model()`: Adjusts confidence based on user feedback
- `validate_confidence_with_examples()`: Tests against known examples
- `combine_categorization_results()`: Merges results from multiple models

### UI Improvements
- Tabbed interface for categorization and settings
- Detailed view with confidence visualization
- Category override controls
- Document preview integration
- Feedback collection forms

## Usage Instructions

1. **Basic Categorization**:
   - Select files in the File Browser
   - Navigate to Document Categorization
   - Choose an AI model
   - Click "Start Categorization"

2. **Advanced Options**:
   - Enable "Two-stage categorization" for better accuracy on difficult documents
   - Set confidence threshold for second-stage analysis
   - Enable "Multi-model consensus" for critical documents

3. **Confidence Settings**:
   - Use the "Confidence Settings" tab to configure thresholds
   - Add validation examples to test categorization accuracy
   - View confidence metrics by confidence level

4. **Reviewing Results**:
   - Use the "Table View" for a quick overview
   - Use the "Detailed View" for in-depth confidence information
   - Override categories manually when needed
   - Provide feedback to improve future categorization
